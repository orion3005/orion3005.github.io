                    <p>
                        I don't really remember when it hit me. It wasn't loud
                        at first, it was more like background noise that became
                        louder over time. I'd give anything for that silence to
                        go away.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I would spend days reflecting to myself trying to
                        convince myself that life comes in waves, has its highs
                        and lows. In order for those happy days to really mean
                        something you need to move through unhappy times too.
                        After all without unhappiness, how could we ever truly
                        understand happiness?
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There's a big difference between understanding and
                        living through something. After a while it starts to
                        feel like something that isn't temporary like a storm
                        and just starts to feel like the normal weather, just
                        the way things are. I often wonder do the happy days
                        ever return or am I just telling myself that to get
                        through the day.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        As I go through the motions of my daily life I
                        continually try my best to find the next distraction,
                        but eventually they run out and the emotions will have
                        to be faced head on. It feels less like living and more
                        like simply existing. It’s such a hollow feeling.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I remember spending an entire weekend once without
                        plans, no one texting to check in. I thought about
                        reaching out to someone, but it felt so exhausting. I
                        didn't even have the energy to be perceived by another
                        person. I wasn't sad, but numb.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I've thought about how I ended up like this, and if I'm
                        being honest I have no fucking idea when I lost touch
                        with everything. It was probably a gradual shift as I
                        was just trying my very best to make it through the day
                        ticking off the check boxes for whatever needed to be
                        done that day. I had forgotten what it was like to
                        really want to do things, to be passionate about
                        something.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Somewhere in the midst of all the numbness, I had a
                        moment of clarity, I had forgotten who I am and I was
                        desperate to remember. I don't know what triggered it,
                        but that moment of clarity didn't feel like an epiphany.
                        It wasn't an overwhelming flood of emotions, but rather
                        something quietly shifted inside of me. There was a
                        small ember lighting the dark numbness. I didn't know
                        what to do with it then or how to act on it, but I knew
                        I had to do something about it.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        I wasn't looking for some grand act of change. Those are
                        never the solution, rather I wanted to reconnect with my
                        inner child. Who was I before the world told me who I
                        needed to be? Obviously its not easy to just jump back
                        into everything the way it used to be. I'm not the same
                        person and neither is the world around me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        So, its better to just start simple. I picked up things
                        I used to enjoy. I started playing my ukulele and
                        singing. I started skateboarding. To be quite honest, I
                        wasn't enjoying them at first. It felt very forced like
                        you're a baby trying to put the square peg in the round
                        hole. My fingers felt stiff trying to play each note.
                        Skateboarding felt awkward as my body had forgotten the
                        rhythm it once moved with. I don't know why, but I
                        persisted. The music doesn't sound great, nor do I glide
                        as smoothly on the skateboard as before but thats okay.
                        Everything slowly got more natural as time went on. I
                        felt myself reconnecting with a part that I once thought
                        was lost forever. Its definitely not about trying to be
                        the person I used to be before either. I am simply
                        letting myself be.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Its a slow process, and I am still in the middle of it.
                        But the energy has shifted. The silence hasn’t
                        completely gone, but most days, it’s no longer
                        overwhelming.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        There’s this line from a Tyler, The Creator song that’s
                        been stuck in my head lately. "They say the loudest in
                        the room is weak That's what they assume, but I disagree
                        I say the loudest in the room Is prolly the loneliest
                        one in the room"
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Those lines stuck with me as I used to be the kind of
                        person that was afraid to talk to stranger, terrified of
                        saying the wrong thing or being perceived as awkward.
                        But lately, I've been forcing myself to speak anyway,
                        even if the outcome is uncomfortable or even
                        disappointing. Because as painful as it is to stumble
                        socially, I've realized it hurts so much more to sit in
                        silence wondering what could've happened if I had just
                        said something.
                    </p>
