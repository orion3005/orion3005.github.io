            <section class="post-content">
                <p>You may be wondering, "Orion, why did you create a blog? Social media exists, who makes a blog in 2024?" You're probably right; this is something most people won't do anymore when there are platforms like Twitter, Facebook, Reddit, and whatever else.</p>

                <p>The reason why I created this blog is that I wanted a more personal space for myself to write my thoughts and put them out into the universe. On this website, I have complete artistic freedom to do anything I want, without the platform-imposed limitations, such as the 240-character limit on Twitter. That limitation can really make it challenging to share more complex ideas.</p>
                
                <p>Then there's Facebook and Instagram, both of which are algorithm-driven. Those algorithms determine what content you see every day. Because of that, a lot of content may or may not end up reaching its intended audience.</p>
                
                <p>There was once a time when the internet wasn't so dominated by social media. I hardly remember it, as I was born in 1996. I started using the internet when I was around 5 years old, but I definitely remember the joy of going to random websites to see what people created. It felt like there was more to explore then. Now, it feels like most internet traffic is going to social media websites and creating websites has become more of a lost art.</p>
                
                <p>Whenever I'm in public, I often find myself observing what people do on their phones, driven by what I consider a "natural curiosity." Typically, it's social media usage, with individuals posting life highlights to portray an enhanced version of their reality. Essentially, individuals curate what they wish to present, meticulously shaping an online identity that might not accurately reflect their true selves.</p>
                
                <p>Overall, I feel social media is mostly a distraction designed to keep you on there as long as possible and monitor everything you do to ultimately serve targeted advertisements. A concept that resonates with me is the notion that when a service is offered at no cost, often, you become the commodity. This is particularly true for social media platforms, which are notorious for collecting extensive amounts of user data.</p>
                
                <p>I don't agree with it, yet I still use certain platforms in order to stay connected with people I consider important to me because I won't be able to talk to them elsewhere. In response to that, I go out of my way to block as many of these advertisements and trackers as possible.</p>
                
                <p>In creating this blog, I'm stepping back to a more introspective approach, one that allows for deeper thought and more meaningful connections, away from the relentless pace of social media. It's an attempt to recapture the essence of the early internetâ€”a place for discovery, genuine expression, and community building, untainted by the commercial and algorithmic influences that dominate our digital spaces today.</p>
                
                <p>I invite you to join me on this journey, to explore topics that matter, to share your thoughts and experiences, and to build a community where dialogue extends beyond the superficial. Let's create a space that values depth over distraction, authenticity over appearance, and personal growth over passive consumption.</p>
                
                <p>Thank you for being here, for reading, and for being a part of this new adventure. Let's see where this path leads us.</p>
